K3 description: movies at 5760 x 4092 (increase of 1.6 over K2 siz) -> 24 megapixels
1,500 (vs 400) full frames per second –> typically average to 75 fps and then to 25 fps (if superresolution double size)
RAtion 6.2 more data than K2

=======================================
* K3 outputs more data than K2, one has to deal with storage capacity seriously if you run a scope effciently. 
Otherwise, one might find that you quickly run out of data storage space. Saving frame data with compression 
and without gain applied has clear advantages here!

* Our K3 system package came with a GP100 Nvidia card. Also there is MotionCor2 utility via DM interface. However,
there is no way to access to MotionCor2 outside of DM. Fortunitely, we can still utilize the powerful GPU card. 
If we run framewatcher to align ~30-40 Super-res frames, it can do as fast as ~10 seconds for one stack.
This is sufficient at least for our session monitoring purpose. Very nice indeed!

Gatan recommendation dose rate for K3: 8-40 e/p/s for the K3. [

“Why is the dark current (= signal acquired in counting mode with the column’s valves closed/no signal) so
high? For the K2 camera, this effect was negligible, as expected for counting mode. For K3, the effect is quite
large (unstable in terms of magnitude, but stable in terms of pattern)”
There are two key changes between K2 and K3 that explain this:
a) For the K2, dark references were recorded periodically (e.g. every 6-12 hours) for a relatively long recording
time (~3 min average). However, pixel “strangeness” (such as hot or dark pixels) varies quickly, meaning after a
certain period the dark reference correction decreases in quality. Thus, Gatan decided to improve the dark
current correction by changing to short dark references acquired right before every recorded image. This process
seems to provide a little bit better correction than the previous method, and for now that’s what Gatan is doing.
